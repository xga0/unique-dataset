# uniqueDataset
A tool for generating unique dataset based on input. Check the tool here: https://unique-dataset.herokuapp.com/.

The main part is a simple .py file that will randomly select 1,000 rows from a 5,000-row house price dataset, generate a .csv file and download it. This was a test for using Flask to turn a Python file to a "webpage". And it was deployed (hosted) by Heroku.
